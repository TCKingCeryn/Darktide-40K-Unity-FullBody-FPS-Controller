** READ ME **
If you imported the package, rather than opening this project directly, you need to add 3 layers.
The Prefabs are expecting the following layers to be at the following indexes, if you already have layers in these slots
then you'll need to manually change the Enemy, Companion, and Player prefabs.  Make sure to check any ragdoll bones as well.

Player = Layer8
Companion = Layer9
Enemy = Layer10

Remember to also set any Ground, Detection, and/or Collision LayerMasks, set the right Detection Layers & Tags on your Player and AI.
Also do this for any Bullets, Weapons, Damage Triggers, etc.

Everything else should work normally!
