** READ ME **

If you imported the package, rather than opening this project directly, the only things you need is to add 3 layers: "Player," "Enemy," and "Companion".
Then in your Player prefab, and all your AI prefabs, set the right Detection Layers & Tags.  Double check all Ragdoll bones as well, to make sure they're on the right Layer.

Also do this for any Bullets, Weapon Hitboxes, Damagers, etc.  Everything else should work normally.
